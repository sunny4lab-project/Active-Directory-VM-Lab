# Introduction to Active Directory VM Lab  </div>

Active Directory (AD) is a critical component of modern IT infrastructure, enabling centralized management of users, computers, and other resources in a networked environment. For IT professionals and enthusiasts, setting up an AD lab at home provides a hands-on learning experience, helping to develop skills essential for managing enterprise environments.
# Overview of the Lab Setup

In this project, you will set up a virtualized environment that includes:

**Windows Server Virtual Machine:** This VM will serve as your domain controller, hosting AD DS (Active Directory Domain Services).

**Windows Client Virtual Machines:** These VMs will join the domain and be used to simulate a typical networked environment.

**Network Configuration:** Ensure communication between the server and client VMs, configure DNS, and optionally set up DHCP.

**Active Directory Configuration:** Promote the server to a domain controller, create a new AD forest, and manage users, groups, and policies.

By the end of this project, you will have a fully functional AD environment in a virtual lab, enabling you to explore and experiment with various AD features and configurations.
